# hyperctl docker image
[![Build Status][status-image]][status-url] [![Open Issues][issues-image]][issues-url]

> This repo creates a minimal docker image containing hyperctl and k8s-vm scripts.

## Usage
# Build the hyperctl image on docker hub
Run it through the pipeline

# Build the hyperctl image locally
Run the command under the root of this repository:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/tmp/src -ti centos /bin/bash -c "cd /tmp/src; bash -xe scripts/hyperctl-build.sh"
```
The above command will create a `hyperctl` binary under current directory.

Replace the `wget` line (downloading the hyperctl binary from github) in the `Dockerfile` with your local hyperctl binary.

```bash
docker build -t screwdrivercd/hyperctl-image:tag .
```
